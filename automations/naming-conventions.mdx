# Automation Naming Conventions

Our team relies on Zapier and Pabbly to automate workflows across different apps and services. Clear, consistent naming helps us:

* Understand where data comes from and where it's going.
* Reduce confusion when onboarding new team members.
* Make it easier to review, update, or troubleshoot automations.

## Automation Naming Conventions

<Note>
  The following guide uses Zapier as a reference for ease of explanation. All principles outlined here apply equally to Zapier, Pabbly and Pipedrive automations.
</Note>

A good rule of thumb is to use a **Source ‚Üí Action/Outcome** structure (or Source ‚Üí Destination).
This immediately tells you (and anyone else looking at the Zap) what the Zap is doing and where the data is flowing.

### Format Example

`[Team / Department] - [Source/Trigger ‚Üí Destination] - [Short Purpose]`

* **Team / Department:** Helps identify ownership (e.g., Marketing, Sales, Finance).
* **Source ‚Üí Destination:** Makes it obvious which apps the Zap connects (e.g., Pipedrive ‚Üí Slack).
* **Short Purpose:** Explains what's happening (e.g., "Send New Lead Notification").

### Sample Names

* Marketing - Pipedrive ‚Üí Slack - New Lead Notification
* Finance - Square ‚Üí Xero - Sync Invoices
* Condo - Calendly ‚Üí Google Sheets - Add Row For New Booking

<Tip>Keep names under 60 characters if possible to avoid truncation in the Zapier interface.</Tip>

## Step Naming Conventions

Inside each automation, you'll have multiple steps (the Trigger step and subsequent Actions).
By default, Zapier and Pabbly will name these based on the app and action, but you should edit them for clarity.

### Format Example

`1. New Booking in Calendly`

`2. Only Continue If Not A Reschedule`

`3. Convert Phone Number To E.164 Format`

`4. Add Row to 'Condo bookings' Sheet`

### Identify the Purpose

**For triggers:** "[What the trigger does]".
> _Example : New Job Completed in Jobber_

**For actions:** "[What the action does]".
> _Example : Send Slack message To 'it-testing' channel_

**For filters/paths:** "Only continue if [Condition]" (Filter) or "Split on [Condition]" (Paths).
> _Example : Only continue if Email exists | Split on Job Source_

**For formatting steps:** "[What the formatting does]".
> _Example : Format completion date to ISO 8601 format_

**For delays:** "[Wait for x]" or "[Wait until x]".
> _Example : Delay for 15 minutes_

**For API requests:** "[Method] - [What the request does]" (Possible methods include GET, POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE).
> _Example : POST - Create Draft Invoice in Square_

### Use a Short, Action-Oriented Description

Instead of the default _"Google Sheets - Create Spreadsheet Row"_, aim for a more descriptive name such as _"Create new lead row in 'Leads Sheet'"_.
This makes it easier to see at a glance what the step is doing without having to open it.

## General Best Practices

### Verb Tense

Use verb-based actions ("Update," "Create," "Send") instead of noun-based descriptions ("Data Update," "New Record Creation").

Example : 

> ‚úÖ Add New Row in "Dispatch KPI" sheet

> ‚ùå Row Creation in "Dispatch KPI" sheet

### Use Common Abbreviations

Refer to the [Glossary](/glossary) page for our team's common abbreviations.

### Special Cases

When in doubt or when naming a complex automation/step, ask yourself the question: "Can a teammate understand the purpose of this automation/step without having to open it?"_. If the answer is no, you should generally try to find a better name.

## Example

### Zap before applying guidelines

‚ùå Unclear Zap name

‚ùå Unclear conditions on the filter

‚ùå Unclear condition on the path‚Ä¶ what is it that we want to be English?  

‚ùå Unclear action‚Ä¶ are we just creating an email as a draft? What's the purpose?

### Zap after applying guidelines

‚úÖ Easy to understand Zap name and data journey

‚úÖ Clear filter conditions

‚úÖ Clear path conditions

‚úÖ Clear action

## Conclusion

By standardizing our naming conventions, we create a powerful framework that makes every automation easy to understand, maintain, and build upon.

Consistency accelerates onboarding, reduces confusion, and streamlines collaboration‚Äîensuring our workflows remain scalable and effective as our team grows and evolves.

**Remember:**

* [Team / Department] - [Source/Trigger ‚Üí Destination] - [Short Purpose]
* Keep it simple.
* Keep it clear.
* Read it from your teammate's perspective.
* Use the verb tense (Create, not Creation).

And most importantly, have fun! üíØ
