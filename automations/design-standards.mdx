# Automation Design Standards

Below is a set of guidelines for designing new automations.

These are meant to ensure that every automation meets the following core criteria: **Efficiency, Simplicity, Scalability, Business Alignment, Maintainability, and Resilience.**

## 1. Efficiency

### Motto

> _"Efficiency is intelligent laziness." – David Dunham_

### What It Means

* **Resource Efficiency**: Minimize the time, tasks, and API calls needed to accomplish the task.
* **Workflow Streamlining**: Eliminate unnecessary steps or redundant logic.

### Key Questions

* Is there a simpler way to achieve the same outcome?
* Are we making any unnecessary API calls or data fetches?
* Can we reduce latency and task consumption by rearranging steps or by using filters/conditions earlier?

### Best Practices

* **Optimize Triggers:** Use precise triggers or filters to start the automation only when necessary.
* **Batch Updates:** If you need to process multiple items, consider batching them in a single step (where applicable) instead of running the same action repeatedly.
* **Divergent Thinking**: Start by drafting multiple designs and considering multiple approaches towards the desired outcome, in order to find the most efficient.

## 2. Simplicity

### Motto

> _"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." – Leonardo da Vinci_

### What It Means

* **Ease of Understanding:** The automation should be straightforward for any team member to grasp.
* **Minimal Complexity:** Fewer steps, fewer paths, and fewer conditional branches—unless absolutely necessary.

### Key Questions

* Can we explain this automation in one or two sentences?
* Could any steps be merged, removed, or simplified?

### Best Practices

* **Use Clear Step Names:** Ensure every step's name describes exactly what it does. Refer to [Automations - Naming Conventions](/automations/naming-conventions) for further details.
* **Limit Conditionals:** Try to avoid overly nested conditions or multiple parallel paths when a simpler approach exists.
* **Document the "Why":** Briefly note the purpose of the automation so future maintainers understand the context.

## 3. Scalability

### Motto

> _"Design today for tomorrow's demand."_

### What It Means

* **Handles Growth:** The automation can support increased data volume, more frequent triggers, or expanded functionality without major modification.
* **Modular Design**: You can add or swap out components (e.g., new data sources or destinations) without breaking the existing flow.

### Key Questions

* Will this workflow still work when the data volume doubles or triples?
* Is there a plan to add new features or fields later—can the design accommodate that?

### Best Practices

* **Modular Steps:** Break workflows into smaller, reusable segments (e.g., a sub-Zap approach if using Zapier. See [below](#sub-zap-methodology) for further details).
* **Avoid Hard-Coded Values:** Store key parameters in environment variables or variables that can be easily updated.
* **Design for Extensibility:** If you anticipate new apps or data fields, keep them in mind during initial setup.

> ### Sub-Zap Methodology
>
> In Zapier, a sub-Zap is essentially a reusable Zap that you can call from inside another "main" Zap. Think of it like creating a function in programming: once you've defined a set of steps or logic you frequently use, you can wrap that into a sub-Zap and then call it from multiple Zaps instead of rebuilding the same actions every time.
>
> **Why Use Sub-Zaps?**
>
> * Reusability: If you have the same process (e.g., formatting data, sending notifications) in multiple Zaps, you can define it once as a sub-Zap and then reference it wherever needed.
> * Simpler Maintenance: When you need to update that shared logic, you do it in one place—the sub-Zap—rather than editing each Zap that needs the update.
> * Scalability: It's easier to expand or modify complex automations by breaking them down into smaller, modular Zaps.
> * Consistency: Ensures that all processes calling the sub-Zap handle data formatting, error handling, etc., in exactly the same way.
>
> **How It Works**
>
> * Create a Sub-Zap: Build a Zap dedicated to one specific function or flow (e.g., "Send Slack Alert" or "Normalize Contact Data").
> * Add a "Sub-Zap" Trigger: Use Zapier's Sub-Zap feature, which allows you to accept input from other Zaps.
> * Reference the Sub-Zap in a Main Zap: In your main automation, add a step that calls the sub-Zap, passing along any necessary data (like a contact's email or message text).
> * Return Output (Optional): If the sub-Zap generates or transforms data, it can send that data back to the main Zap, which can continue processing.
> By structuring automations in a modular way with sub-Zaps, you keep them clean, efficient, and much easier to manage over time.

## 4. Business Alignment

### Motto

> _"There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all." – Peter Drucker_

### What It Means

* **Supports Real Business Needs:** The automation has a clear, measurable impact on the organization.
* **Delivers Tangible Value:** Either by saving time, cutting costs, or providing necessary insights. Never automate simply for the sake of automation itself.

### Key Questions

* Does the automation accurately and reliably solve the initial issue/request?
* Does this automation directly align with a business goal (e.g., lead conversion, customer retention)?
* What is the ROI on creating and maintaining this automation?
* Can we measure the success (KPIs or metrics) once this is deployed?

### Best Practices

* **Stakeholder Involvement:** Work closely with the teams who will benefit from the automation to ensure it addresses their pain points.
* **Define Success Metrics:** Consult with your PM/Supervisor to track metrics like time saved, error reduction, or revenue impact.
* **Continuous Feedback:** Gather feedback from end-users to refine the process over time.

## 5. Maintainability

### Motto

> _"If it's too fragile to change, it's not maintainable."_

### What It Means

* **Long-Term Upkeep:** Automations should be easy to update as apps, data structures, or business logic change.
* **Collaboration & Handover:** Different team members might maintain or troubleshoot the automation.

### Key Questions

* Can a new team member quickly understand how to modify or fix this?
* Is all relevant logic clearly documented?

### Best Practices

* **Version Control:** Keep a history of changes (and reasons for them) on the Miro documentation.
* **Naming & Comments:** Use descriptive names for variables, steps, and references.
* **Regular Reviews:** Set a schedule to revisit automations and confirm they're still aligned with current processes.
* **Clear Documentation:** Make sure the Miro documentation is as detailed as possible. Always assume the reader has zero knowledge of the automation, its context or its purpose.

## 6. Resilience

### Motto

> _"If you don't design for failure, you're designing for it to happen silently."_

### What It Means

* **Avoid Downtime:** Automations that fail silently can cause data loss or operation breaks.
* **Graceful Error Handling:** If something goes wrong, the system should alert the right people and, if possible, retry or fail without disrupting downstream processes.

### Key Questions

* What happens if an API call fails or times out?
* Do we have alerts or notifications set up for failures?

### Best Practices

* **Use Filters & Error Handlers:** Catch errors and handle them proactively. Make sure to implement error handling in critical points of the code (in the case of a Python or JS task).
* **Test Extreme Scenarios:** Validate how the automation behaves with large data sets or unexpected inputs.
* **Implement Notifications:** Send error alerts to a Slack channel or email group.

## Bringing It All Together

### Key Criteria

* **Efficiency:** Minimize waste and optimize performance.
* **Simplicity:** Keep it clear, simple and easy to understand.
* **Scalability:** Ensure it can handle future growth or feature additions.
* **Business Alignment:** Tie it to real business needs and outcomes.
* **Maintainability:** Make sure it's easy to update, troubleshoot, and hand off.
* **Resilience:** Plan for errors and ensure the automation can handle edge cases gracefully.
