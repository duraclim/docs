</Frame>

## What is Pabbly Connect?

Pabbly Connect is an automation platform similar to Zapier that allows you to connect different applications and create workflows without writing code. In Pabbly terminology, these automations are called "Workflows" (equivalent to Zapier's "Zaps").

## When to Use Pabbly

At Duraclim, we use Pabbly Connect for:

- High-volume automations where task usage would be expensive in Zapier
- Stable, straightforward workflows that require less frequent debugging
- Integrations where all necessary apps are available in Pabbly
- Non-critical automations where occasional delays are acceptable
- Cost-efficient processing of repetitive tasks

<Note>
  Pabbly's pricing model is based on the number of workflows and connections rather than task execution count, making it more economical for high-volume automations.
</Note>

  lastName = lastName || '';
  
  // Format the name with proper capitalization
  firstName = firstName.trim().charAt(0).toUpperCase() + firstName.trim().slice(1).toLowerCase();
  lastName = lastName.trim().charAt(0).toUpperCase() + lastName.trim().slice(1).toLowerCase();
  
  return {
    formattedFirstName: firstName,
    formattedLastName: lastName,
    fullName: `${firstName} ${lastName}`.trim()
  };
}

// Process the inputs
const result = formatName(data.firstName, data.lastName);

// Return the formatted values
return {
  first_name: result.formattedFirstName,
  last_name: result.formattedLastName,
  full_name: result.fullName
};
```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Workflow Management

### Organizing Workflows

To keep workflows organized:

1. Use consistent naming following our [naming conventions](/automations/naming-conventions)
2. Add detailed descriptions to each workflow
3. Use tags to categorize workflows (e.g., #sales, #operations, #notifications)
4. Group related workflows in folders

### Monitoring and Alerting

To ensure your workflows run smoothly:

1. Regularly check the task history for errors
2. Set up error notifications for critical workflows
3. Create a monitoring workflow that checks for failures and sends alerts
4. Document expected behavior and error handling procedures

### Version Control

Pabbly doesn't have built-in versioning, so follow these practices:

1. Clone workflows before making significant changes
2. Keep a changelog in the workflow description
3. Use a naming convention for versions (e.g., append "v2.0" to the name)
4. Document changes in the shared Miro board for critical workflows

## Troubleshooting

When a workflow isn't working as expected:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check task history">
    View recent task executions to identify where the failure occurred.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Examine error messages">
    Pabbly provides error details that can help diagnose the issue.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test individual steps">
    Use the testing feature to verify each step in isolation.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify connections">
    Ensure all app connections are still valid and working.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check data mapping">
    Incorrect data mapping is a common source of errors.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Look for recent changes">
    If a previously working workflow failed, check if any third-party apps have changed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

    3. Parse the incoming data using Pabbly's formatters
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Simpler Conditional Logic">
    **Limitation:** Pabbly's conditional logic is less flexible than Zapier's Paths.
    
    **Workaround:** Use multiple conditions in sequence or split into separate workflows.
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    Instead of complex branching paths, create:
    1. A base workflow with simple conditions
    2. Webhook outputs for complex cases
    3. Separate workflows triggered by these webhooks
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Limited Error Handling">
    **Limitation:** Pabbly has fewer error handling options.
    
    **Workaround:** Create dedicated error-handling workflows triggered by webhooks.
