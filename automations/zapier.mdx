# Zapier

[Zapier](https://zapier.com/) is our primary automation platform for connecting apps and services. This guide provides detailed information on how to use Zapier effectively at Duraclim, following our established practices and standards.

</Frame>

## What is Zapier?

Zapier is a web-based service that allows you to connect different applications and automate workflows without writing code. Each automation in Zapier is called a "Zap" and consists of a trigger (what starts the automation) and one or more actions (what happens when the trigger fires).

## When to Use Zapier

At Duraclim, we use Zapier for:

- Higher reliability workflows where uptime is critical
- Integrations that require specialized Zapier apps not available in Pabbly
- Complex logic flows with multiple conditions and branching paths
- Workflows where easy troubleshooting is a priority
- Lower volume automations (due to Zapier's task-based pricing model)

## Account Access

To access our Zapier account:

1. Request access from the IT department via the [Access Request Form](https://forms.duraclim.com/access-request)
2. You'll receive an invitation email from Zapier
3. Accept the invitation and set up your account
4. You'll be added to our Zapier workspace as a Team Member

<Note>
  Always use your Duraclim email address when accepting the invitation.

## Advanced Zapier Features

### Paths

Paths allow your Zap to take different actions based on conditions:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/zapier-paths.png" alt="Zapier Paths" className="rounded-lg" />
</Frame>

To set up paths:

1. Click the "+" icon after a step and select "Paths"
2. Set up a condition for the first path (e.g., "Only continue if [Field] contains [Value]")
3. Add actions for that path
4. Add additional paths as needed
5. Optionally add a "Default path" for cases that don't match any condition

### Filters

Filters let you stop a Zap from continuing unless certain conditions are met:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/zapier-filters.png" alt="Zapier Filters" className="rounded-lg" />
</Frame>

To add a filter:

1. Click the "+" icon after a step and select "Filter"
2. Set up your conditions (e.g., "Only continue if [Field] exists")
3. Test the filter with sample data

### Formatters

Formatters help manipulate data between steps without needing a separate app:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/zapier-formatters.png" alt="Zapier Formatters" className="rounded-lg" />
</Frame>

Common formatter uses:

- Text formatting (lowercase, uppercase, capitalize)
- Number formatting (round, format as currency)
- Date formatting (convert between formats)
- Lookup tables (map values to new values)
- Utilities (extract email, phone formatting)

### Code Steps

For complex transformations, use Code steps to run JavaScript:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/zapier-code.png" alt="Zapier Code" className="rounded-lg" />
</Frame>

Example code step for formatting a phone number:

```javascript
// Input: inputData.phoneNumber (e.g., "123-456-7890")
// Output: Formatted E.164 phone number
function formatPhoneNumber(phone) {
  // Remove all non-digit characters
  const digitsOnly = phone.replace(/\D/g, '');
  
  // Ensure it has 10 digits (US number)
  if (digitsOnly.length !== 10) {
    return phone; // Return original if not valid
  }
  
  // Format as E.164 (add +1 for US)
  return `+1${digitsOnly}`;
}

output = { 
  formattedPhone: formatPhoneNumber(inputData.phoneNumber)
};
```

### Sub-Zaps

Sub-Zaps allow you to create reusable components:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/zapier-subzaps.png" alt="Zapier Sub-Zaps" className="rounded-lg" />
</Frame>

To create a Sub-Zap:

1. Create a new Zap with the "Zapier" trigger app
2. Choose "Run Sub-Zap" as the trigger event
3. Configure the inputs the Sub-Zap will accept
4. Build the actions for the Sub-Zap
5. To use the Sub-Zap, add a "Run a Sub-Zap" action in another Zap

See our [Automation Design Standards](/automations/design-standards#sub-zap-methodology) for more details on when and how to use Sub-Zaps.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Task Management

Zapier charges based on the number of "tasks" used. A task is counted each time your Zap successfully completes an action:

- Each action step in a Zap counts as one task
- Filter steps don't count as tasks unless the condition is met
- Path steps only count for the path that's taken

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Task Efficiency" icon="gauge-simple-high">
    To minimize task usage:
    
    - Use filters early in your Zaps to prevent unnecessary actions
    - Combine multiple actions in a single Zap where appropriate
    - Use built-in formatters instead of separate formatter steps when possible
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Monitoring Usage" icon="chart-line">
    Monitor your task usage:
    
    - Check the usage dashboard regularly
    - Set up usage alerts (Admin settings > Usage Alerts)
    - Review high-task-usage Zaps for optimization
    - Consider moving high-volume automations to Pabbly
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting Zaps

When a Zap isn't working as expected:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Zap history">
    Go to the Zap's "Task History" tab to see recent runs and their status.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review error messages">
    Click on failed tasks to see detailed error messages that can help identify the issue.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test each step">
    In the Zap editor, test each step individually to find where the problem occurs.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check app connections">
    Ensure your app connections are still valid and working properly.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify triggers">
    Make sure your trigger is still receiving data as expected.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check for data formatting issues">
    Often, errors occur because data isn't formatted as the destination app expects.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review recent changes">
    If a previously working Zap stops working, check if any recent changes to connected apps might be causing the issue.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Duraclim Zapier Guidelines

### Documentation Requirements

Every Zap should have:

1. A clear, descriptive name following our [naming conventions](/automations/naming-conventions)
2. Description field filled out explaining the Zap's purpose
3. Folder assignment for organization
4. Miro documentation if it's a complex or critical Zap

### Testing Protocol

Before turning on a production Zap:

1. Test every step thoroughly
2. Run complete end-to-end tests
3. Verify with real data when possible
4. Have another team member review the Zap for complex automations

### Change Management

When modifying existing Zaps:

1. Clone the Zap instead of editing directly if it's a major change
2. Document the changes in the Zap description
3. Re-test all steps after making changes
4. Update any external documentation
