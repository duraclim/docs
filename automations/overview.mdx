# Automations Overview

Duraclim IT leverages automation tools to streamline workflows, reduce manual tasks, and improve operational efficiency. This document provides an overview of our automation infrastructure, platforms, and strategic approach.

</Frame>

## Automation Philosophy

Our approach to automation is guided by the following principles:

1. **Value-Driven**: We prioritize automations that provide the highest business value
2. **User-Centric**: Automations should simplify workflows for end users
3. **Maintainability**: Automations should be well-documented, modular, and maintainable
4. **Resilience**: Automations should handle errors gracefully and be self-healing
5. **Incremental Improvement**: Start with critical pain points and iterate

## Automation Platforms

We use a combination of platforms to implement our automation strategy:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Zapier" icon="zapier">
    Cloud-based automation platform for connecting apps and services
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Pabbly Connect" icon="plug">
    Cost-effective alternative to Zapier for high-volume automations
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Custom Scripts" icon="code">
    Python and JavaScript scripts for specialized automation needs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Platform Selection Criteria

The choice between Zapier, Pabbly, or custom scripts depends on several factors:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Zapier When">
    - Integration requires a specialized Zapier app
    - Reliability is critical
    - Complex logic with multiple steps is needed
    - Easy troubleshooting is a priority
    - Integration is low-volume (due to Zapier's pricing model)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Pabbly When">
    - Integration involves high-volume data
    - Cost-efficiency is a primary concern
    - The automation is stable and requires minimal debugging
    - The necessary integrations are available in Pabbly
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Custom Scripts When">
    - Specialized logic not available in Zapier or Pabbly is required
    - Direct database access is needed
    - Performance is critical
    - Complex data transformations are required
    - A custom API integration is needed
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Key Automation Categories

Our automations fall into several main categories:

### 1. Data Synchronization

Automations that keep data consistent across different systems:

- CRM to Database synchronization
- Customer data updates between platforms
- Inventory synchronization
- Quote and invoice data transfer

### 2. Notification Systems

Automations that send notifications to users and team members:

- Customer appointment reminders
- Team alerts for critical events
- Service completion notifications
- Overdue task reminders

### 3. Document Generation

Automations that create and distribute documents:

- Invoice generation
- Quote creation
- Contract preparation
- Report generation

### 4. Workflow Automation

Automations that streamline business processes:

- Customer onboarding
- Service scheduling
- Lead qualification
- Payment processing

### 5. Data Collection and Reporting

Automations that gather and process data:

- Customer feedback collection
- Performance metrics tracking
- Sales analytics
- Service efficiency monitoring

## Automation Architecture

Our automation architecture follows a modular approach:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/automation-architecture.png" alt="Automation Architecture" className="rounded-lg" />
</Frame>

### Components

1. **Triggers**: Events that initiate automations (form submissions, database changes, etc.)
2. **Workflows**: The sequence of steps to process the triggered event
3. **Actions**: Individual tasks performed within a workflow
4. **Integrations**: Connections to external systems and services
5. **Error Handling**: Mechanisms to handle failures and exceptions

### Integration Strategies

We use several strategies to connect our various systems:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Direct API Integration">
    - REST API calls between systems
    - GraphQL queries for complex data requirements
    - Webhook triggers for event-based integration
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Database-Level Integration">
    - Direct database connections for critical systems
    - Read-only views for reporting systems
    - Change data capture for event triggers
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="File-Based Integration">
    - CSV exports/imports for batch processing
    - PDF generation for document sharing
    - XML/JSON file transfers for structured data
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Middleware Integration">
    - Zapier/Pabbly as middleware between systems
    - Custom API gateways for complex integrations
    - Message queues for asynchronous processing
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Automation Patterns

### 1. Event-Driven Pattern

This pattern triggers automations based on specific events:

```
[Event] → [Filter] → [Process] → [Output]
```

**Example**: When a new lead form is submitted, create a contact in CRM, assign to a sales rep, and send a notification.

### 2. Scheduled Pattern

This pattern runs automations at predetermined intervals:

```
[Schedule] → [Fetch Data] → [Process] → [Output]
```

**Example**: Every Monday at 8 AM, generate a weekly sales report and email it to the management team.

### 3. Polling Pattern

This pattern regularly checks for changes or conditions:

```
[Poll] → [Check for Changes] → [Process if Changed] → [Output]
```

**Example**: Check for new rows in a Google Sheet every 15 minutes and process any new entries.

### 4. Approval Pattern

This pattern includes human approval steps:

```
[Trigger] → [Initial Process] → [Request Approval] → [Complete Process]
```

**Example**: When a quote exceeds $5,000, prepare the quote and send it to a manager for approval before sending to the customer.

## Automation Lifecycle

We follow a structured lifecycle for our automation projects:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Opportunity">
    Identify manual processes that are repetitive, time-consuming, or error-prone
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define Requirements">
    Document the current process, input/output requirements, and success criteria
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Design Solution">
    Create a workflow diagram, select the appropriate platform, and plan integration points
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Build Automation">
    Implement the automation on the selected platform
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test">
    Verify the automation works as expected with various test cases
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Document">
    Create comprehensive documentation including purpose, flow, error handling, and maintenance procedures
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Move the automation to production
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor & Maintain">
    Regularly review usage, errors, and performance; update as needed
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Automation Governance

To ensure our automations remain maintainable and effective:

### Documentation Standards

All automations must include:

- Purpose and business value
- Diagram of the workflow
- List of integrated systems
- Trigger conditions
- Expected inputs and outputs
- Error handling approach
- Owner and stakeholders
- Monitoring and alert procedures

### Naming Conventions

We follow strict [naming conventions](/automations/naming-conventions) for all automations to ensure clarity and consistency.

### Testing Requirements

Before deployment, automations must be tested for:

- Happy path functionality
- Error handling
- Edge cases
- Performance under load (if applicable)
- Security considerations

### Monitoring and Maintenance

All production automations include:

- Error logging
- Usage tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Regular reviews
- Scheduled maintenance
