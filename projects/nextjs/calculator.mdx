## Core Calculators

The application includes three main calculators:

### 1. Casa (Residential) Calculator

The Casa calculator determines pricing for residential duct cleaning services based on:

- Number of vents
- Home size (square footage)
- Additional services (sanitization, etc.)
- Dryer vent cleaning

### 2. Condo Calculator

The Condo calculator determines pricing for condominium cleaning services based on:

- Condominium type
- Number of vents
- Additional services
- Building location

### 3. Air Commun Calculator

The Air Commun calculator handles specialized air quality services for larger buildings.

## Key Components

### Cart System

The cart system allows users to add multiple services to a quotation:

```typescript
// Path: components/calculator/cart/cart-drawer.tsx
export function CartDrawer() {
  const { items, total } = useCartStore();
  const { isCartOpen, toggleCart } = useAppStore();
  
  // Implementation details...
}
```

### Pricing Calculations

Pricing calculations are handled by specialized functions in each service store:

```typescript
// Path: lib/stores/useCasaStore.ts
export const useCasaStore = create<CasaStore>((set, get) => ({
  // State properties...
  
  calculatePrice: () => {
    const { vents, squareFootage, additionalServices } = get();
    // Calculation logic...
    return finalPrice;
  },
}));
```

### Multi-language Support

The application supports English and French through Next.js's internationalization features:

```typescript
// Path: i18n/routing.ts
export const locales = ['en', 'fr'] as const;
export const defaultLocale = 'en' as const;
```

    # Edit .env.local with your local values
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start development server">
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deployment
