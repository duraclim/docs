This document outlines our approach to meetings at Duraclim IT, including scheduling, preparation, facilitation, and follow-up processes. Our goal is to ensure meetings are purposeful, efficient, and respectful of everyone's time.

## Meeting Philosophy

At Duraclim IT, we view meetings as a valuable but limited resource. We follow these principles:

1. **Default to Asynchronous**: Consider if a meeting is necessary or if the goal can be achieved asynchronously
2. **Clear Purpose**: Every meeting should have a defined purpose and expected outcomes
3. **Respect Time**: Start and end on schedule, with focused agendas
4. **Inclusive Participation**: Everyone should have the opportunity to contribute
5. **Document Outcomes**: Decisions and action items should be recorded and shared

## Before the Meeting

### Determine if a Meeting is Necessary

Before scheduling a meeting, ask yourself:

1. Could this be handled asynchronously via Slack, email, or Loom?
2. Do we need real-time collaboration or immediate feedback?
3. Is the topic complex enough to warrant face-to-face discussion?
4. Do we need to build consensus or make a group decision?

<Tip>
  For information sharing without discussion, consider sending a document or recording a brief Loom video instead of scheduling a meeting.
</Tip>

### Meeting Request Guidelines

When creating a calendar invitation:

- **Clear Title**: Use a descriptive meeting title
- **Purpose Statement**: Begin with a single sentence describing the purpose
- **Agenda**: List specific topics with time allocations
- **Required Preparation**: Note any materials attendees should review
- **Expected Outcomes**: State what should be accomplished
- **Attendees**: Only invite those who need to participate

Example meeting invitation:

```
Title: Q1 Feature Prioritization Decision

Purpose: Decide which features to prioritize for Q1 development

Agenda:
- Review feature backlog (10 min)
- Discuss technical feasibility (15 min)
- Evaluate customer impact (15 min)
- Make prioritization decisions (15 min)
- Assign next steps (5 min)

Please review:
- Feature backlog document: [link]
- Customer feedback summary: [link]

Expected outcomes:
- Prioritized list of Q1 features
- Initial assignments for requirements gathering
```

## During the Meeting

### Starting the Meeting

Start every meeting effectively:

1. **Begin on time**, regardless of who is present
2. **Restate the purpose** and expected outcomes
3. **Review the agenda** and adjust if necessary
4. **Assign roles** if appropriate (facilitator, timekeeper, note-taker)
5. **Set collaboration expectations** for the meeting

### Facilitation Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep Discussion Focused">
    - Refer back to the agenda regularly
    - Gently redirect off-topic conversations
    - Acknowledge tangential points for future discussion
    - Use a "parking lot" for important topics that aren't on the agenda
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Ensure Balanced Participation">
    - Create space for quieter participants to contribute
    - Consider round-robin formats for certain discussions
    - Be aware of who is dominating the conversation
    - Use techniques like "I'd like to hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Manage Time Effectively">
    - Assign a timekeeper or use visible timers
    - Provide time warnings ("We have 5 minutes left on this topic")
    - Be willing to table discussions that need more time
    - Start wrapping up 5-10 minutes before the scheduled end time
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Drive Toward Decisions">
    - Clarify when a decision needs to be made
    - Use clear decision-making frameworks when needed
    - Document decisions as they are made
    - Confirm understanding and agreement before moving on
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Remote Meeting Considerations

For virtual meetings:

- **Test technology** before the meeting begins
- **Use video** when possible to increase engagement
- **Leverage chat** for questions and parallel discussions
- **Consider a facilitator** to manage virtual participation
- **Use collaborative tools** like shared documents or digital whiteboards
- **Be mindful of time zones** when scheduling
- **Record the meeting** (with permission) for those who cannot attend

### Note-Taking Guidelines

Effective meeting notes should:

- **Capture key points**, not verbatim discussion
- **Document all decisions made**
- **Record action items** with owners and deadlines
- **Note open questions** that need follow-up
- **Be distributed promptly** after the meeting

Template for meeting notes:

```

```

## After the Meeting

### Follow-up Process

After every meeting:

1. **Distribute notes** within 24 hours
2. **Add action items** to the appropriate task management system
3. **Schedule follow-up meetings** if needed
4. **Share decisions** with stakeholders who weren't present
5. **Collect feedback** on meeting effectiveness

### Evaluating Meeting Effectiveness

Periodically assess meeting effectiveness with these questions:

- Did we accomplish the stated purpose?
- Was everyone's time well used?
- Did all participants have the opportunity to contribute?
- Were decisions documented and communicated?
- Did we start and end on time?
- What could we improve for next time?

### Meeting-Free Blocks

## Meeting Anti-Patterns

Be aware of these common meeting problems and how to avoid them:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The Status Meeting Trap">
    **Problem**: Meetings that only share updates without discussion or decisions
    
    **Solution**: Use asynchronous methods (Slack, email, Loom) for status updates and reserve meetings for discussion and decision-making
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="The Runaway Meeting">
    **Problem**: Meetings that consistently run over the scheduled time
    
    **Solution**: Set clear timeboxes, assign a timekeeper, and be disciplined about ending on time
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="The Ambiguous Purpose">
    **Problem**: Meetings without a clear purpose or expected outcomes
    
    **Solution**: Always define and communicate the specific purpose and desired outcomes in the invitation
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="The Over-Invitation">
    **Problem**: Inviting too many people "just in case" or "for visibility"
    
    **Solution**: Only invite those who need to actively participate; share notes with others afterward
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="The Preparation Gap">
    **Problem**: Participants haven't reviewed necessary materials beforehand
    
    **Solution**: Clearly communicate pre-reading expectations and consider rescheduling if key participants aren't prepared
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Conclusion

Effective meetings are a critical part of our collaborative work environment. By following these guidelines, we can ensure our meetings are productive, efficient, and respectful of everyone's time.

Remember that meetings should create value, not consume it. Always question whether a meeting is the best format for your needs, and be prepared to suggest alternatives when appropriate.

If you have suggestions for improving our meeting practices, please share them in the #it-discussions Slack channel.
