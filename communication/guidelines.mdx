# Team Communication Guidelines

## Purpose

Our internal communication should:

* Foster clear, efficient, and transparent collaboration.
* Encourage respectful exchanges of ideas, ensuring everyone feels comfortable contributing.
* Support quick decision-making and seamless information flow.
* Leverage asynchronous video where appropriate to reduce unnecessary synchronous (live) meetings.

## General Guidelines

### Assume Positive Intent

> Approach conversations with the belief that colleagues are working in good faith.
>
> Misunderstandings can happen; clarify before assuming negative motives.

### Be Proactive & Self-Serve

> If you can find the answer in a shared doc or knowledge base, do so before asking.
>
> This reduces repetitive questions and helps everyone be more efficient.

### Respect Boundaries

> People have different work hours and responsibilities.
>
> Use asynchronous communication—written, or video—when possible; avoid expecting immediate responses unless it's truly urgent.

### Choose the Right Medium

> Some topics are best handled via quick Slack messages.
> 
> Others may benefit from a short asynchronous video (via Loom, Komodo Decks, etc.) if you need to demonstrate, walk through a document, or explain something visually.

## Message Etiquette

### Keep Topics Relevant

>Post in the right channel to keep information organized and discoverable.
>
>* **#it** : use for important team-wide announcements and sharing resources
>* **#it-testing** : use for automation testing
>* **#it-discussions** : use for general discussions and every day talk
>* **#it-asana** : used by the Asana integration for task progress notifications
>* **#it-alerts** : use for alerts triggered by error handling

### Use Threads

> If you're responding to a specific message, reply in a thread.
>
> Threads keep channels tidy and make follow-up easier to track.

### Be Brief & Specific

> State your purpose or question clearly in the first line.
>
> Use bullet points or short paragraphs to break up large blocks of text.

### Use Mentions Sparingly

>Mention individuals (@username) only when necessary—this sends a direct notification.
>
> For urgent or high-priority items, consider also using channel mentions like @channel or @here, but do so sparingly.

### Add Context

> Provide links, screenshots, or short summaries so colleagues don't have to hunt for details.
>
> Example: _"@username, here's the Miro for reference: [Link]. I need feedback on the Flow Diagram section."_

### Use Emoji Reacts Wisely

> Emoji reactions can convey acknowledgment (👍), gratitude (🙏), or agreement (✔️).
>
> They reduce clutter from "Thanks!" or "Noted!" messages.

### Respect Time Zones & Work Hours

> If something can wait, don't DM or mention colleagues after their typical workday.
>
> Either set yourself a reminder or schedule a message to be sent later (by clicking the dropdown next to the Send button on Slack).

## Using Loom or Komodo Decks for Asynchronous Communication

### When to Use Asynchronous Video

> **Demonstrations:** If you need to show how to navigate a tool or explain a design concept, a screen-recorded demo can be more efficient than a lengthy text explanation.
> **Detailed Walkthroughs:** Instead of a live call or Google Meet, record a short video explaining the context, questions, or feedback you need.

### Keep Videos Short & Focused

> Aim for 5 minutes or less per recording unless absolutely necessary.
>
> Break longer topics into smaller clips if possible, so team members can watch only the parts relevant to them.

### Provide a Summary

> Include a brief summary in the Slack message when sharing the link
>
> Example : _"This video explains the new onboarding flow. Jump to minute 2:00 if you just want to see changes brought to the pipeline"._

### Add Chapters or Timestamps

> Loom and Komodo Decks allow adding timestamps or chapters to long recordings, making it easier to skip to relevant sections.

### Request Clear Next Steps

> After recording, specify what feedback or action you require.
>
> Example: _"Please watch this 3-minute video by end of day and let me know if the proposed solution fits your requirements."_

### Keep Threaded Discussions

> Post the video link in Slack, and encourage any questions or feedback to go in the same thread. This keeps the conversation organized.

## How to Ask for Meetings

### Start with Asynchronous Communication

> Post a text explanation or record a short Loom/Komodo Deck to provide context. Often, quick questions or clarifications can be resolved without a live meeting.

### Provide Agenda & Context

> If a live discussion is necessary, explain why. Include a clear agenda and desired outcomes to keep the meeting focused.

### Confirm & Follow Up

> Tag participants to ensure they know the meeting is scheduled. After the meeting, summarize key decisions or action items in the relevant Slack channel (and record a Loom/Komodo Deck summary if needed).

## Respectful Discussions & Debates

### Use a Professional, Constructive Tone

> Attack the problem, not the person.
> Frame disagreements around ideas or methods rather than personal traits.

### Seek Understanding Before Responding

> Ask clarifying questions if something is unclear ("Could you elaborate on X?").
> Reflect back what you've heard to ensure you understand correctly before responding.

### Offer Evidence & Examples

> Back your points with data, user feedback, or references.
> Make it easier for others to see your perspective.

### Stay Open to Other Viewpoints

> If someone has a conflicting idea, consider it fully before dismissing it.
> Aim for a "yes, and" or "yes, but" approach, acknowledging their points while sharing your own.

### Agree on Next Steps

> End debates by clarifying action items or concluding decisions.
> Document in Slack or a shared doc so the resolution is visible to everyone.

## Conclusion

By adopting these communication conventions—including the use of asynchronous video with Loom or Komodo Decks—our team will foster an environment of clarity, respect, and efficiency.

The ultimate goal is to support open collaboration while reducing friction and avoiding unnecessary live meetings. As we continue using Slack and related tools for day-to-day work, we'll periodically review and update these guidelines to ensure they align with our evolving processes and team culture.
