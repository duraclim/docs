### Project-Specific Channels

We create temporary channels for major projects with the naming convention `#it-project-[name]`. These channels are archived when the project is completed.

### Direct Messages

Use direct messages (DMs) for:
- Private conversations that don't benefit the broader team
- Sensitive discussions about personnel or confidential matters
- Quick questions for specific individuals

<Tip>
  Consider if your DM conversation might benefit others before keeping it private. If others could learn from the exchange, use a public channel instead.
</Tip>

### Group DMs

Group DMs are useful for small team collaborations that don't warrant a dedicated channel. Limit group DMs to 3-8 people to keep conversations manageable.

### Slack Etiquette

- **Working Hours**: Respect team members' working hours when sending messages
- **Status Updates**: Keep your status updated to reflect availability
- **Reactions**: Use emoji reactions to acknowledge messages that don't need a reply
- **Threads**: Use threads for replies to keep channels organized
- **Formatted Messages**: Use formatting for clarity:
  - \`code\` for technical references 
  - *italics* for emphasis
  - **bold** for important points
  - Bulleted lists for multiple items

## Email

Email is used primarily for formal communication with external parties and for important announcements that need to be preserved.

### When to Use Email

- External communication with clients, vendors, or partners
- Formal announcements that need to be referenced later
- Sharing documents that require a paper trail
- Communications that involve legal or HR matters

### Email Etiquette

- Use clear subject lines that reflect the content
- Keep emails concise with one main topic per email
- Use professional greetings and closings
- Respond to emails within 24 business hours, even if just to acknowledge receipt
- Use "Reply All" sparingly and thoughtfully

## Video Communication

### Loom/Komodo Decks

Asynchronous video messaging is encouraged for:

- Demonstrating features or bugs
- Walking through documents or designs
- Explaining complex concepts
- Providing detailed feedback

<Frame>

</Frame>

### Best Practices

- Keep videos under 5 minutes when possible
- Start with a clear introduction of the topic
- Share your screen when demonstrating
- End with clear action items or questions
- Add timestamps for longer videos
- Include a brief text summary when sharing the video

## Google Meet

Google Meet is our platform for synchronous video meetings.

### When to Use Google Meet

- Scheduled team meetings
- One-on-one check-ins
- Discussions that benefit from real-time interaction
- Client presentations
- Collaborative brainstorming sessions

See our [Meetings documentation](/communication/meetings) for detailed guidelines on meeting etiquette and best practices.

## Project Documentation

### Google Docs, Sheets & Slides

Used for collaborative documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

- **Google Docs**: Project plans, policies, standard operating procedures
- **Google Sheets**: Data tracking, budgets, schedules
- **Google Slides**: Presentations, training materials

### Miro

Used for visual collaboration, including:

- Workflow diagrams
- Process maps
- Brainstorming sessions
- Project planning

</Frame>

### GitHub Repositories

Used for code documentation and technical specifications:

- README files
- API documentation
- Technical design documents
- Setup instructions

## Knowledge Base (This Wiki)

Our internal knowledge base (the site you're currently viewing) serves as the central repository for:

- Process documentation
- Technical guides
- Onboarding materials
- Best practices
- Reference information

<Tip>
  When creating content, always consider whether it should be added to the knowledge base for future reference. If you find yourself repeatedly sharing the same information, it's a good candidate for the knowledge base.
</Tip>

## Channel Switching Guidelines

### When to Switch Channels

- **From Slack to Video**: When a text conversation becomes complex or requires visual explanation
- **From Slack to Meeting**: When discussion requires input from multiple stakeholders or real-time collaboration
- **From Email to Slack**: When a formal email thread evolves into an internal discussion
- **From DM to Channel**: When a private conversation would benefit the broader team

### How to Switch Effectively

1. Summarize the conversation to that point
2. Clearly state why you're suggesting a channel switch
3. Provide the necessary information for others to join the new channel
4. Document any decisions made after switching
