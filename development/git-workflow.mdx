## Branch Strategy

We follow a modified GitFlow workflow with the following branch types:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="main">
    The production branch containing the code currently deployed to production.
    
    - Always deployable
    - Protected from direct commits
    - Only accepts merges from release branches and hotfixes
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="develop">
    The main development branch containing the latest code for the next release.
    
    - Integration branch for all feature branches
    - May not be stable at all times
    - Used for testing the next release
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="feature/[name]">
    Branches for developing new features or enhancements.
    
    - Always branched from `develop`
    - Merged back into `develop` when the feature is complete
    - Should be named descriptively: `feature/add-cart-functionality`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="fix/[name]">
    Branches for fixing bugs in the development environment.
    
    - Branched from `develop`
    - Merged back into `develop` when the fix is complete
    - Should be named descriptively: `fix/cart-total-calculation`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="release/[version]">
    Branches for preparing releases.
    
    - Branched from `develop` when it contains all features for a release
    - Only accepts bug fixes, documentation updates, and other release-oriented changes
    - Merged into both `main` and `develop` when ready
    - Named with version numbers: `release/1.2.0`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="hotfix/[name]">
    Branches for critical fixes to production code.
    
    - Branched from `main`
    - Merged into both `main` and `develop` when the fix is complete
    - Named descriptively: `hotfix/critical-auth-vulnerability`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Workflow Steps

### Starting a New Feature

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ensure develop is up to date">
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a feature branch">
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Implement the feature">
    Make changes, add files, and commit regularly with meaningful commit messages
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Keep your branch updated">
    Regularly update your branch with changes from develop:
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop
    git checkout feature/my-new-feature
    git merge develop
    ```
    
    Resolve any conflicts that arise
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a pull request">
    When the feature is complete, push your branch and create a pull request into `develop`
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/my-new-feature
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Implement the fix">
    Make the necessary changes to fix the bug
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a pull request">
    Push your branch and create a pull request into `develop`
    ```bash
    git push origin fix/bug-description
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Creating a Release

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a release branch">
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop

    git merge hotfix/critical-fix
    git push origin main
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a tag">
    ```bash
    git tag -a v1.2.1 -m "Hotfix: Critical issue fix"
    git push origin v1.2.1
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Merge to develop">
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop
    git merge hotfix/critical-fix
    git push origin develop

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect the code's meaning (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or correcting tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or tools

### Examples

```
feat(cart): add ability to adjust quantities

- Added +/- buttons to cart items
- Implemented quantity validation
- Updated cart total calculation

Closes #123
```

```
fix(auth): resolve token refresh issue during session expiration

The application was not correctly refreshing tokens when the session
expired, causing users to be unexpectedly logged out. This fix
implements proper token refresh logic.

Fixes #456
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

When creating a pull request:

1. Use a clear, descriptive title
2. Include a detailed description of the changes
3. Reference any related issues using the issue number (#123)
4. Assign appropriate reviewers
5. Add relevant labels

### Pull Request Template

We use the following template for pull requests:

```markdown
## Description
Briefly describe the changes in this pull request.

## Related Issues
Closes #issue_number

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change

Describe the tests you ran to verify your changes.

## Checklist
- [ ] My code follows the style guidelines of this project
- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my own code
- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation
- [ ] My changes generate no new warnings

- [ ] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes
```

## Code Review Process

### Reviewer Guidelines

When reviewing code, focus on:

1. **Functionality** - Does the code work as expected?
2. **Code quality** - Is the code readable, maintainable, and following our standards?
3. **Performance** - Are there any obvious performance issues?
4. **Security** - Are there any security concerns?
5. **Tests** - Are the tests appropriate and adequate?

### Author Guidelines

When responding to reviews:

1. Address all comments
2. Explain your reasoning for not making certain changes if applicable
3. Update the PR with requested changes
4. Request another review when ready

## Git Hooks

We use Git hooks to automate certain checks before commits and pushes:

### Pre-commit Hook

Our pre-commit hook:

1. Runs linters on changed files
2. Formats code according to our standards
3. Runs relevant tests

To set up the pre-commit hook:

```bash
npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged
npx husky install
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx lint-staged"
```

Configure `lint-staged` in `package.json`:

```json
"lint-staged": {
  "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": [
    "eslint --fix",
    "prettier --write"
  ],
  "*.{json,md}": [
    "prettier --write"
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

### Keep Branches Short-lived

- Feature branches should typically not live longer than 1-2 weeks
- If a feature is larger, break it down into smaller, manageable pieces

### Commit Frequently

- Make small, focused commits
- Each commit should represent a logical unit of work
- Avoid "work in progress" commits

### Write Meaningful Commit Messages

- Be specific about what changes are included
- Make it clear why the change was made
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

### Keep Pull Requests Focused

- A PR should address a single concern
- Avoid mixing unrelated changes
- Large PRs (>300 lines) are harder to review effectively

### Resolve Conflicts Promptly

- Keep your branch updated with the latest changes from its parent branch
- Resolve conflicts as soon as they appear

## Troubleshooting

### Undoing a Commit

If you need to undo the last commit but keep the changes:

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

If you need to completely discard the last commit and its changes:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Stashing Changes

To temporarily save changes without committing:

```bash
git stash save "work in progress on feature X"
```

To apply the stashed changes later:

```bash
git stash list
git stash apply stash@{0}
```

### Resolving Merge Conflicts

When you encounter merge conflicts:

1. Use `git status` to see which files have conflicts
2. Open each file and look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
3. Resolve each conflict by choosing one version or merging them
4. Mark the conflict as resolved with `git add <filename>`
5. Complete the merge with `git commit`
