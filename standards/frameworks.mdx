## Technology Decision Records

We document important technology decisions using Technology Decision Records (TDRs). These can be found in the `docs/tdr` directory of our main repositories.

Example TDR structure:

```markdown
# TDR-001: Adoption of Next.js App Router

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We needed to modernize our frontend architecture to support better performance, 
improved developer experience, and more efficient data loading patterns.

## Decision
We will adopt the Next.js App Router for all new projects and gradually migrate 
existing projects from the Pages Router.

## Consequences
- Better performance through React Server Components
- Improved developer experience with more intuitive routing
- Need for team training on the new paradigm
- Temporary maintenance of two routing patterns during transition
```

## Technology Evaluation Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify need">
    Clearly articulate the problem or opportunity the technology addresses
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Research options">
    Research potential solutions and create a shortlist
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create evaluation criteria">
    Define specific criteria for evaluation based on our needs
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Proof of concept">
    Build a small proof of concept to test the technology
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Team review">
    Present findings to the team for feedback
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Decision and documentation">
    Make a decision and document it as a TDR
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Implementation plan">
    Create a plan for adoption, including training and migration
  </Step>
</Steps>
